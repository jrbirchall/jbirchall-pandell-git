Pandell Application

Implementation of the Shuffle screening problem.

Feel free to comment, raise defects and do code reviews on GitHub though I will be deleting this project after
we're done.

In general, this has been a surprising amount of fun and I appreciate the opportunity to apply.

Best regards,

James.
